## Pros and Cons of TDD

There are many developmental benefits of using TDD including being able to automate testing of new features and ensure that when new features or code is added to the repository, that old features and functionality can be checked to work automatically. As a result, this also gives a higher degree of confidence in the codebase during deployment even when the codebase is changed or edited. Moreover, testing can be more thorough and consider previously considered edge cases that other people working on the codebase may not think of when editing or adding new features.

TDD can have cons as well, such as the possibility of having brittle tests that may fail when more complex changes or fundamental changes are made to the repository. Moreover, for large repository changes, individual unit tests will have to be changed or redesigned which may require additional engineering costs.
